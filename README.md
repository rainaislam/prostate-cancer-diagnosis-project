## Project Overview
This project is an in-depth study of the current challenges in diagnosing prostate cancer, focusing on the limitations of widely used methods such as PSA testing, Digital Rectal Exam (DRE), and advanced imaging techniques. The project evaluates emerging biomarkers and diagnostic tools to improve accuracy and reduce the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

## Objectives
- To evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of current prostate cancer diagnostic methods.
- To explore emerging diagnostic tools and biomarkers for early and accurate detection.
- To highlight the concerns surrounding overdiagnosis and overtreatment in prostate cancer.

## Methods
- **Literature Review**: Extensive research using academic papers, articles, and books to compile relevant data.
- **Diagnostic Techniques Studied**:
  - PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) testing
  - Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)
  - Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS)
  - Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
  - Emerging biomarkers like hK2, PSMA, and AMACR

## Key Findings
- **PSA Testing**: While PSA testing is widely used, it suffers from poor specificity, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
- **Emerging Biomarkers**: New biomarkers, such as hK2 and PSMA, show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy but require further validation.
- **Overdiagnosis Concern**: Many men diagnosed with prostate cancer through screening would not have experienced clinical symptoms or mortality from the disease, raising concerns about unnecessary treatments.
  
## Visuals
- Figures on prostate cancer prevalence, PSA levels, and prostate gland images are included in the [project PDF](https://github.com/rainaislam/prostate-cancer-diagnosis-project/blob/main/Challenges-in-prostate-cancer-diagnosis.pdf).

## Conclusion
Prostate cancer diagnosis remains a challenge, with a need for better tools to distinguish between aggressive and indolent cancers. Emerging biomarkers and next-generation diagnostic tools offer hope for more accurate screening, though more clinical trials are required.

## Future Work
- Validation of emerging biomarkers through prospective clinical trials.
- Development of non-invasive diagnostic methods with higher sensitivity and specificity.
